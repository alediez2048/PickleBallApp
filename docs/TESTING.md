# PicklePass Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the PicklePass application. Our testing approach is comprehensive, covering multiple levels of testing to ensure the application's reliability and functionality.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on testing individual components and functions in isolation.

#### Key Areas:
- Components
- Utility functions
- Hooks
- Context providers
- API service functions

#### Tools:
- Jest
- React Native Testing Library
- Jest Native

### 2. Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that different parts of the application work together correctly.

#### Key Areas:
- Navigation flows
- Context interactions
- API integration
- Data persistence
- Form submissions

### 3. End-to-End Testing

E2E tests simulate real user interactions across the entire application.

#### Key Areas:
- User journeys
- Authentication flows
- Game booking process
- Profile management
- Payment processing

#### Tools:
- Detox

## Test Organization

Tests are organized following the same structure as the source code:

```
src/
  __tests__/        # Global test utilities and setup
  components/
    __tests__/      # Component tests
  contexts/
    __tests__/      # Context tests
  services/
    __tests__/      # Service tests
  utils/
    __tests__/      # Utility tests
```

## Writing Tests

### Component Tests

```typescript
import { render, fireEvent } from '@/utils/test-utils';
import MyComponent from '../MyComponent';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    const { getByText } = render(<MyComponent />);
    expect(getByText('Expected Text')).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

### Context Tests

```typescript
import { renderHook } from '@testing-library/react-hooks';
import { useMyContext } from '../MyContext';

describe('MyContext', () => {
  it('provides expected values', () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useMyContext());
    expect(result.current).toHaveProperty('expectedProperty');
  });
});
```

## Test Coverage

We aim for the following coverage thresholds:
- Statements: 70%
- Branches: 70%
- Functions: 70%
- Lines: 70%

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- path/to/test.test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

## Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state of other tests.
2. **Meaningful Assertions**: Test behavior, not implementation details.
3. **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior.
4. **Setup and Teardown**: Use beforeEach/afterEach for common setup and cleanup.
5. **Mock External Dependencies**: Use jest.mock() for external services and APIs.

## Error Handling Testing

Test both success and error scenarios:
- Network errors
- Validation errors
- Authentication errors
- Permission errors
- Edge cases

## Cross-Device Testing

Test the application across different:
- Screen sizes
- OS versions (iOS/Android)
- Device capabilities
- Network conditions

## CI/CD Integration

Tests are run automatically on:
- Pull requests
- Merges to main branches
- Release builds

## Debugging Tests

1. Use `console.log()` or `debug()` to inspect component output
2. Use Jest's `--verbose` flag for detailed output
3. Use snapshot testing for complex component structures
4. Use Jest's debugging capabilities with VS Code

## Maintenance

1. Regular review and updates of test cases
2. Removal of obsolete tests
3. Update mocks and fixtures as needed
4. Monitor and improve test performance
